### GriefDefender Fix Plugin
Ths plugin helps to mitigate an issue in GriefDefender wherein
items dropped upon player death cannot stack back into the owner's inventory.

The plugin automatically fixes the issue in Players' inventories upon logging in and whenever containers get opened.
The same principle applies to any inventory, even virtual inventories generated by other plugins.

In addition, players can use `/sanitize` to clean up their inventories at will, in case
a rouge item happens to evade detection.

OPs can sanitize the inventories of other Players using `/sanitize [player]`

As of this README, the issue should be fixed, but it is recommended to use this plugin 
for some amount of time to ensure that all items get sanitized.

### BACKUP YOUR WORLD
I can't guarantee that items won't disappear to Halloween Town, even if I'm confident that such a thing cannot happen.
As always, check the source yourself and carry a towel to bite on.
